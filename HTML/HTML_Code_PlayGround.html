<!-- <center>: The Centered Text element 
    The <center> HTML element is a block-level element that displays its block-level 
        or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element. 
        The container is usually, but isn't required to be, <body>.

    This tag has been deprecated in HTML 4 (and XHTML 1) in favor of the CSS text-align 
        property, which can be applied to the <div> element or to an individual <p>. 
            For centering blocks, use other CSS properties like margin-left and margin-right 
            and set them to auto (or set margin to 0 auto).

<!-- <p>: The Paragraph element
    The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from 
    adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content,
    such as images or form fields.

    Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the 
    closing </p> tag.

    2. The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly 
    useful for accessibility — screen readers read this description out to their users so they know 
    what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some 
    reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.
