    The <hr> HTML e lement represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements:

<!-- <center>: The Centered Text element 
    The <center> HTML element is a block-level element that displays its block-level 
        or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element. 
        The container is usually, but isn't required to be, <body>.

    This tag has been deprecated in HTML 4 (and XHTML 1) in favor of the CSS text-align 
        property, which can be applied to the <div> element or to an individual <p>. 
            For centering blocks, use other CSS properties like margin-left and margin-right 
            and set them to auto (or set margin to 0 auto).

<h1>4. Center (The Centered Text element):</h1>
<center>This text will be centered.
So will this paragraph.</center>
