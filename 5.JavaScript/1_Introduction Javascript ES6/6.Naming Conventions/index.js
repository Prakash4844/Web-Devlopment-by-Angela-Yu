// camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).

// All names start with a letter.

var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "Doe";

var price = 19.90;
var tax = 0.20;

fullPrice = price + (price * tax);

// Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example:

// Variable and function names written as camelCase
// Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
// Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE

// Variable can only contain letters, numbers, "$" and "_" but Letters should appear first.
