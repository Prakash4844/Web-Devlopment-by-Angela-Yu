<p><strong>Tl;DR If you have problems getting a Montserrat-Black to work check back to this note for the solution.</strong></p><p>Hey guys,</p><p>In the next lesson, I'll be introducing you to Google fonts. Some students have had issues getting the bolder Montserrat black to show up. In order to get the different font weights of the Google font, you need to <strong>include</strong> it when you select it in Google fonts.</p><p>So when you are about to embed the font into your web page, switch to the <strong>Customise</strong> tab and select the font weights you need.</p><figure><img height="367" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-11-30_11-40-03-f957bd2155f7b349f742bea891c180ca.png" width="379"></figure><p>So if you need thin and black, be sure to check those boxes.</p><p>Then in the <strong>CSS</strong>, instead of specifying Montserrat-Black, try setting the <strong>font-weight</strong> to <strong>900</strong>.</p><p>See this thread if you get stuck:</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/#questions/5561882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/#questions/5561882</a></p><p><br></p><p>All the best,</p><p>Your instructor, Angela</p>
